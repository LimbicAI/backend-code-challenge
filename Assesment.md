# Back End Code Challenge

In this Back End Coding Challenge Limbic would like to see your skills and coding habits in a production server environment.

Please don't spend more than about 8 hours on this.  We are mostly interested in seeing your coding style and patterns, even if you don't finish everything.

# The Challenge

You are tasked with writing an API to create Users and Posts. It should be a Node.js server with the following endpoints:

- Register a new user to database
- Create a new post for user in database
- Return user and his posts

## Stack Options:

You can pick from 2 different tech stacks, which are of equal interest to us:

### *PostgreSQL*

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Apollo GraphQL
- PostgreSQL (you may use an ORM like Sequelize if you like)
- Jest / Mocha-Chai

### *MongoDB*

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB (you may use libs other than the native one if you like)
- Jest / Mocha-Chai

## Requirements:

- It should be production quality as you understand it, i.e. tests, Docker, README, documentation, etc.

## Things we're looking for:

- TypeScript
- Project structure
- Unit tests
- API design
- Error handling
- Dockerize the service

## Bonus! 

The following tasks are not required, but will give you an extra bonus if you complete them

- Update user, taking into consideration possible concurrency issues
- Integration tests

# Submitting:

### Option A:

- Fork this repo
- Issue a Pull Request when you're ready to start. This will count as your starting date
- Set up your development environment chosen
- Implement your server
- Commit changes into the forked repo

### Option B:

- Setup your development environment chosen
- Implement your server
- Archive your solution into a zip file
- Send us the zip file. We should be able to extract the content and run it from there (w/o node_modules)
