# backend-code-challenge

My main motiviation with this project is to see what you do with foreign code, but only generally, and in small amount of hours. 
I think this should be doable, even without any graphql experience before. It might be useful to read through the Apollo Graphql Tutorial first, 
to give some basic introduction to graphql as a whole.

I'd like how far you come in 8 hours or so. Really don't spend more time on it, I just want to see how you code, not necessarily how fast!

If you get stuck with the setup, chat us up ASAP, because I wouldn't feel good when you'd be spending time on that.

# Goal for you!

You are tasked with writing a piece of software to do Checks and Balances.
It must comprise an Apollo Graphql Server with the following queries / mutations:

- [ ] Register a new user to database
- [ ] Login this user
- [ ] Update this user (must be protected resource)
- [ ] Return user (must be protected resource)

## Requirements:

- You should take concurrency issues into consideration, eg multiple concurrent updates;
- It must be production quality according to your understanding of it - tests, README, etc.

## General notes:

- You will submit the source code for your solution to us as a compressed file containing all the code and possible documentation. Please make sure to not include unnecessary files such as the Git repository, compiled binaries, etc;
- Please do not upload your solution to public repositories in GitHub, BitBucket, etc.

## Things we're looking for:

- Unit and integration tests;
- API design;
- Error handling.
